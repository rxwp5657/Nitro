# Nitro
Nitro is a real-time 3D renderer built using C++ and OpenGL that aims to implement the latest rendering techniques such as: 
+ Physically Based Rendering (PBR).
+ Ambient Occlusion.
+ Parallax Occlusion Mapping.
+ Normal Maping.
+ Environment Mapping.
+ Dynamic Shadow Mapping.
+ Atmospheric Scattering. 
+ Bloom.
+ Volumetric lighting.
+ Deferred Rendering.
  
Also, another of the objectives of Nitro is to implement core aspects of a renderer from scratch (except model loading since we want to test the renderer with a number of models):
+ Virtual Camera: Movement and Rotation.
+ Light Sources:  Point Lights, Directional Lights and SpotLights.
+ Primitives:     Planes, Cubes and Spheres.
+ Event System.

## How to build:
Clone the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rxwp5657/Nitro.git
```

Download and init project dependencies with the following command:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive  lib/
```

Create a build directory on the project root folder ../Nitro/build and change into that directory:
```bash
mkdir build && cd build
```

Type the following commands:
```bash
cmake ..
make && ./nitro
```

## How to use:
Move through the scene by using WASD and your mouse as you like and exit by pressing ESC on your keyboard (artifacts appearing becuase of GIF format):
