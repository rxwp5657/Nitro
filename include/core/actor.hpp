/*
    Basically, an actor is every entity that participates on a scene like a
    sphere, trees, soldiers, etc. 

    Currently, an actor should be capable of appearing on a scene. Thus,
    requiring a model that contains all vertex data (vertices, normals,
    tangents, bitangents, etc.). However, the actor remains having a "reference" 
    to a shader as the first attempt of forward rendering was based on the idea 
    of effects being implemented on self-contained shaders. For example, if an 
    actor needed to implement parallax occlusion it would need to add the 
    "parallax-occlusion" reference to the list of shaders so on the rendering pass
    the effect would only be applied to those objects that have the "reference" to 
    the shader.

    However, after changing the render path to forward rendering per light the 
    list of references is not used anymore. On the other hand, until deferred
    rendering is implemented or the structure of materials is not revised 
    (adding control uniforms of wheter or not a special effect should be applied) 
    the class will keep the list of special efects to be applied.

                orientation (Rotation), size (Scaling) and Color of the actor's model.

                However, this set of function is still not complete as the following 
                set of attributes need to be accessible:

                    - Refractivity.

                    - Enabling texture.
                    - Disabling a texture.
